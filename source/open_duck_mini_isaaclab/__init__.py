"""Open Duck Mini V2 Isaac Lab extension — registers the Joystick task.

Registration is best-effort: this package also contains pure-torch modules
(reference_motion/, tasks/velocity/rewards.py, joint_order.py) that are
imported directly by tests/*.py on machines with no Isaac Sim/gymnasium
install (see tests/README or docs/decisions.md — Mac-runnable verification
is a deliberate design goal, not an afterthought). Since any submodule
import runs this file first, a hard ImportError here would break those
tests too. On a real Isaac Lab machine, gymnasium and isaaclab_rl are
always present and registration proceeds normally.
